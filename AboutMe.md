  - I also spent most of my time watching Youtube. These days, I like to watch **SciShow**, Food vlogs, Movies or Series Recaps, **Vox**, and documentary videos. I also watch game highlights and VTubers 🐇. My favorite VTuber is Anya Melissa from Hololive Indonesia.

## Programming Life

I do competitive programming, I like to solve algorithmic problems, and love to code myself a new project, doing something in a sitting is my favorite. My favorite techs 💻 are:

- Web Backend:
  - Gin Gonic, Echo in GoLang 🌲
  - FastAPI and Django in Python,💧
  - Next.js in Typescript or JS! 🔥
- Web Frontend
  - Next.js 🌈
  - Vanilla HTML! (really love doing these manual css HAHHAHAHA 🤦‍♀️)
- Programming Languages (Ordered descending from the best):
  - C++ (This just plain fun) 😭
  - Python, TS, Js (Interpreted languages are fine)
  - Golang (Blazingly fast, but poor library support 👀)
  - (I don't really like Java because it feels slow HAHAHAHA)

- Operating Systems (Ordered by my most to least favorite):

  - Ubuntu (A good OS to code, very light and easily customizable!) 🚩
  - Windows (No native linux support, WSL is nasty i hate it, Superior for productivity and having fun) 😱 
  - Mac OS (Python modules on M1 has tons and tons of issues, Virtual Memory setting for C++ is very uncustomizable, I still hate the keyboard layout, apps are expensive, battery is amazing, support is amazing, the most seamless in terms of performance compared to other OS) 🐍

- Favorite personal projects:

  - **PeerToCP**, with Electron.js, WebRTC. A real time collaboration coding desktop IDE which allows you to share IDE and handle disconnection/offline issue.
